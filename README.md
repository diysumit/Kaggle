## Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

### Random Forest Descision Tree Classifier

Created a Random Forest Descision Tree Classifier for training and evalutaion of the dataset using Sckit-Learn, this is one of easier ways of implementing a classifier and it works pretty well for most of the part if the huge variety of data is available. Achieved 77.03% of accuracy.

## Digit Recognizer

### Deep Neural Network Classifier

Created a Deep Neural Network Classifier for training and evalutaion of the dataset using TensorFlow, this is once again one of the most popular beginning projects for people who are interested in Deep Learning. Achieved 96.97% of accuracy.

## Spaceship Titanic

### Random Forest Descision Tree Classifier

Created a Random Forest Descision Tree Classifier for training and evalutaion of the dataset using Sckit-Learn, the decision tree classifier created in this project was deeper than the ealier project whose name is resembles.
